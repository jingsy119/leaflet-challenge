# leaflet-challenge
## Background
### This challenge is to visualize all earthquakes that took place in the past 7 days based on the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
## Technical Information
### A JSON representation of the earthquake data is given via the USGS website. The Javascript package, Leaflet, was used to create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude. 
### The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes would appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth would appear darker in color. Popups are included to provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
